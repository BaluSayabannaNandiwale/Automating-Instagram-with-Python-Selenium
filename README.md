ðŸš€ Automating Instagram with Python & Selenium

I recently developed a Python script utilizing Selenium to streamline my Instagram management. This script automates the following tasks:

Logs into Instagram using provided credentials.

Retrieves the list of users I follow and those who follow me back.

Identifies and unfollows users who don't reciprocate the follow, with a cap of 50 users per session to avoid detection.

The script introduces random time delays to mimic human behavior, ensuring smooth execution while complying with platform policies.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with similar automation tasks! #Python #Selenium #Automation #Instagram
